        <p className="mb-4">
          Morragame is an interactive guessing game where two "players" (Player 1, the user, and Player 2, the computer) each select a secret number. Player 1 inputs their <strong>choice</strong> and <strong>guess</strong> through the frontend interface, while Player 2's choices are randomly generated by the computer. The goal is for each player to guess the combined sum of both players' choices.

        <ul className="list-disc pl-5 text-left mx-auto max-w-md mb-6">
          <li className="mb-2"><strong>0</strong>: Itâ€™s a tie! Neither player guessed the sum correctly.</li>
          <li className="mb-2"><strong>1</strong>: Player 1 (you) won the round by correctly guessing the sum.</li>
          <li className="mb-2"><strong>2</strong>: Player 2 (computer) won the round with a correct guess.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Adjust your guesses in subsequent rounds to try to outsmart the computer!
